# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles with [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## Installation

To get started, install homesick first:

```bash
$ gem install homesick
```

Next, use the homesick command to clone the castle:

```bash
$ homesick clone git://github.com/caedes/dotfiles.git
```

With the castle cloned, link its contents into home dir:

```bash
$ homesick symlink dotfiles
```
